27-Oct - Sultan
    discussed merits of DeMastri's approach and started independent approach
27-Oct - Sultan
    implemented part-2
    found bug related to test script not handling corner case were a customer is faster than the barber at coming in to the shop vs barber waking update
    noted bug case on piazza and logged specific run in slow_barber_fast_customer.txt
27-Oct - Sultan
    fixed compilation bug when reusing queue code from project 0
    implemented part-3 
    looked into statistics gathering code for timers and improved on DeMastri's statistics collection
27-OCt - Sultan
    added automatic statistics collection script (metric_collect.sh) based on compiler flags
    script changes one of following parameter against defaults defined in project prompt:
        BARBER_SLEEP_TIME
        CUSTOMER_SLEEP_TIME
        CUSTOMER_COUNT
        BARBER_COUNT
        MAX_CHAIR_COUNT
    added metric aggregation script (metric_aggregate.py) that aggregates all metrics in a nice CSV file
1-Nov - Sultan
    updated progress.txt
    added a "MAKE_TEST_SCRIPT_HAPPY" compiler flag + special compilation for it in make file
        Flag controls printing for customers when they leave (splits it accross barber and customer)
        This was done to handle and unhandled corner case in the test script
        when flag is disabled (default compilation disables it) normal behavior occurs with printing (no cross printing between barbers and customers)
    added part-1 pdf from DeMastri branch

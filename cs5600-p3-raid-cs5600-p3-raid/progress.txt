    finished part 1 and mostly part 2 code
    placeholders for test files
    updated makefile accordingly
    initialized this files

    finished detailed part 1 testing
    debugged part 2 (stripe) - nasty pointer error took lots of time...
    finished detailed part 2 testing except for detail writes

15-Nov-20 - DeMastri
    finished testing stripe and raid
    raid IS a stripe structure, leverages some code
    changed so if any (stripe), >1 (mirror), >2 (raid) drives fail, any access fails
        even if the read/write could be satisfied (fail drive 2 on raid, drive 1 *could* be read)
        this is correct according to TA
        required either "fake read" of all drives (inefficient) or use of image_test(), 
            not sure if that was intended to be part of the public interface for image
    finished writing the detailed test suite for all
    will look at this for "cleanliness" closer to presentation
    also renamed a couple of functions as stripe_xxx from strip_xxx for consistency - hope the grader doesn't care...
    functionally complete

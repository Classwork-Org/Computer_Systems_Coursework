testing plan for each part of this project:

---------- mirror ------------
the actions we have are create / read / write / close
the parameters that might be interesting are:
	r/w starting at blk 0 or >0, illegal values, 1 or multiple block reads
each of these can be tested in "test modes":
	normal mode - both drives available
	degraded mode a - with one drive dead: a
	after degraded drive a replaced
	degraded mode b - with one drive dead: b
	after degraded drive b replaced
	with both drives failed
		all tests should work as in normal mode for all cases except the last - all should fail

0 - create test images - 5 blocks each
	a 1-2 - two with data in each block set to the block number
	b 1-2 - two with data in each block set serially to 'a-z' repeating
	c 1-2 - two set to all zeros
1 - create tests
	a - pass different size drives in - fail expected
	b - pass one null drives in - fail expected
	c - pass both null drives in - fail expected
	d - pass same size drives in a:block, b:alpha - pass expected mirror reports correct size
			test to show image contents not affected on create
			- read block 1 - should be data from first image - "block" data
			- fail drive 1
			- read block 1 - should be data from second image "alpha" data
			- replace drive 1 with a clone of original first image
			- read block 1 - should be data from second image (drive 1 overwritten on replace)

for each test mode
	create mirror from "block" images
	fail drives (or not) appropriate to this mode
	2 - read tests
		read (start,len) and verify results:  (0,1), (1,1), (0,3), (2,3) should all pass
		read (-1,0), (0,0), (2,-2), (0,6), (2,4) - should all fail
		NOTE - if test mode is "both drives fail", then all read tests should fail
	3 - write tests
		write identifiable data to (start,len) and verify results across entire length (should ONLY write requested blocks):
			(0,1), (1,1), (0,3), (2,3) should all pass
		write (-1,0), (0,0), (2,-2), (0,6), (2,4) - should all fail
		NOTE - if test mode is "both drives fail", then all write tests should fail
	4 - close test
		close mirror
		try to read / write / replace drive - each should fail.
		final "mirror-modex-test-result-image-d" should reflect expected results for manual inspection
			where x is 1-6 (normal, deg a, deg b repl, deg b, deg b repl, both fail)
			where d is drive 'a' or 'b'

---------- stripe ------------
similar to mirror, except that 
  * no failures are tolerated
  * updates to stripes need to be managed properly across different disks

create-tests
read-tests
write-tests

---------- raid04 ------------
similar to mirror in that data is duplicated so it is fault tolerant 
  * same tests as mirror should be reusable, except for failures across all drives including parity

create-tests
read-tests
write-tests

----------  end   ------------

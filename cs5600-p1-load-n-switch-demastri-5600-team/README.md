Overview
======
A modern compiled program is quite complex, pulling in thousands of lines of include files and using dozens of shared libraries in addition to "hidden" code the compiler adds to the executable for things like exception handling, threads, and other startup and shutdown tasks. In this assignment we'll ignore all this, and create some executables using only the files in your directory. 

In this homework you will implement simple versions of several basic operating system functions:

- invoking system calls
- program loading
- system call tables

You are provided with the following files:
- "syscall.S" - defines a `syscall` function, not surprising used to invoke system calls without using the system libraries
- "sysdefs.h" - all the `#defines` you'll need to use the "syscall.S" and the other assembly files
- "elf64.h" - defines for parsing executable file headers, so that your program can load an executable into memory and then execute it
- "vector.S", "call-vector.S" - creates a miniature system call table, so that those programs can access functions in your main program
- "switch.S", "stack.c" - switches stacks, to create multiple threads, and prepares a stack frame for starting a thread
- "Makefile" - contains somewhat unusual compile commands so that all of this will work.


[Part 1 -- read / write / exit](part-1.md)
---------------
In this part you are going to write a "bare" program which reads input and writes output, without using any of the C standard library, C runtime library, or include files. You'll write functions to invoke the `read` and `write` system calls, and other functions to read lines of input and write strings to output, using the `read()` and `write()` functions which you wrote, and then combine them into a simple loop to echo what you typed and exit on "quit".

[Part 2 -- Program loading / syscalls](part-2.md)
--------------
For the second part you'll write a simple "single-user operating system" that runs specially-compiled "micro-programs". These programs don't perform I/O on their own, but instead call functions in *your* code via a system call table. Your program will act as a simple shell, reading a line, splitting it into words, loading a program and starting it with arguments.

[Part 3 -- Context Switching](part-3.md)
---------------
This part will create two processes (really threads), process 1 and process 2, and load an executable into each one, placing each one at a different position in memory. You will give each a stack, and implement three functions: `yield12` and `yield21` which switch from thread 1 to thread 2, and from 2 to 1, and `exit` which switches back to the main program.


CS 5600 Project Rules
================

Teams and collaboration
---------------------
I expect you to work in teams of two students; you will submit one copy of the homework and receive the same grade. Feel free to discuss the ideas in the homework with other groups, but absolutely no sharing of code across groups is allowed. All your code should come from your own fingers typing on the keyboard -- if you're copy-and-pasting it from somewhere (from another team or from the Internet) it's likely to be academic dishonesty.

Submitting your work
------------------
You do not need to explicitly submit your assignment -- your grade will be based on the code in your repository at the time it is due.

Commit and push your work frequently
---------------------------------
Commit your changes frequently ??at least once every day that you are working on the project, and preferably much more often. These checkins serve to document that you and your teammate wrote the code you are submitting, rather than copying it from someone else. Failure to check in frequently will result in a lower grade.

Progress report
-------------
You will be required to submit a progress report partway through the assignment. This is a text file in your repository (named progress.txt) describing the work you have done so far and your plans for finishing the project. It can include things like "discussed design of part X", or "implemented Y function", etc.  Remember to use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` so I can see your report. It's a good idea to create this file at the very beginning and use it to make notes on the work you've done.

Testing
------
You are expected to implement tests for your code and to check them in as part of the assignment. (As a general rule, code that hasn't been tested doesn't work. Therefore if you didn't test your code but it passes my tests, then it's a lucky accident and doesn't deserve as good a grade as if you actually tested it and know it works)  Run your tests under `valgrind`, as well -- it will catch a lot of bugs before they actually happen.

Code Quality
-----------
Unlike most workplaces or open-source projects, the coding standards for this class are minimal. They are:

1. Initialize every variable when you declare it.
2. Get rid of all compiler warnings. There's almost always a good reason the compiler is complaining -- fix it. 
3. Indent your code consistently and reasonably.
4. Use reasonable variable and function names. If you change what a function does, **change the name of the function to reflect that**.
5. Comments are for comments, not for code. Your editor has a perfectly good "delete line" function, and Git can keep track of things that you deleted.

Other than #1 and #2, these can all be described as **Don't write ugly code**. Take some pride in your work; don't turn in something that makes you look bad.

Grading
------
Things you can lose points for:

- Failure to achieve any progress by the progress report date, or failure to commit your code frequently.
- Really ugly code, compiler warnings, uninitialized variables
- Failure to implement all of the requested functionality. 
- Test failures (on the grading tests) 
- Not enough testing.

24-Sep - DeMastri
    - pulled initial code, reviewed with part 1 assignment directions
    - started part 1, initially bypassing read syscall and take input from strings
    - finished  syscalls for working command line to echo keyboard input 
    ** committed part 1 - git commit ccf5ebd
    - wrapped read bypass with USE_READTEST define to make it easier to
    - completed part 1, refactored to allow main() to be clearer
    ** committed part 1 - git commit d4cf271
25-Sep - DeMastri
    - review code for part 2 with assignment directions
    - moved syscalls from part 1
    - wrote 'echotest' to take a line of input, break it into parts and echo the parts
    - wrote 'readtest' to test the file i/o syscalls to open and echo a text file, then close it
    - write 'exec_file' and 'exectest' to load a file, map the loadable sections and run it
    - with the syscalls and exec_file written and tested, wrote and verified the main command loop
    ** committed part 2 - git commit 53af8ce
    - review code for part 3 with assignment directions
    - moved syscalls from part 2
    - modified 'exec_file'->'load_file' as recommended to return the entry and load to a provided offset
    - wrote 'nop' switching syscalls and manually started one process to validate the load method
    - wrote the initial stack setup code and switched into process 1 - failed (as expected) on return
    - finished the stack setup code - initially reset stack on every switch...loop - constant restarts
    - fixed the switch code to properly maintain separate "active" variables for each of the 3 stacks
    - tested by switching into process 1 -> saw switches/outputs as expected by the assignment spec
    ** committed part 3 - git commit abfb4d7
    - added this file 'progress.txt'
    ** committed progress.txt - git commit 9fbd57a
    - added code to gracefully handle empty command lines for part 2 (no seg fault...)
    ** committed part 2 - git commit 9202702
    - added prompt/output tag to part 1 to make those interactions easier to follow.
    ** committed part 1 - git commit tbd
